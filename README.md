*Machine Learning Modeller* is a web-based application developed using various technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, for front-end development and Python, Django, and MySQL for back-end development. The main purpose of this project to help the developers and programmers to train their Machine Learning Models just by uploading their dataset and choose their algorithm. The Machine Learning Modeller serves the users as a platform for them to train their machine learning model and take predictions on their favourable inputs. It will save their a lot of time as they need not to start from the scratch. They just need to upload their dataset on which model will train and one more csv file which will contain instances on which it needs output. On the other hand as of now, they need to start from the very beginning and it will require a lot of efforts, hard-work and time. And also users do not need to have vast knowledge on machine learning like how the machine learning algorithms work, but they only need to know which algorithm is used to train which type of model. This web site can be used any user who has any basic idea of how to use internet.  An also users need not to worry about confidentiality of their data as we will not store their data on our website. It will help users to save their a lot of time and effort.
